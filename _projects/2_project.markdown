**Onomatic**

Onomatic is a tool that utilizes sound to teach language. Deriving from onomatopoeia, the formation of a word through the phonetic imitation of the sound it makes, this system focuses on listening and speaking tools to help users learn.

Each language class comes with lessons tailored toward specific scenarios. A lesson comes with a set of cards. The card can vocalize the new word, an example sentence, part of speech, etc. in both the native and target languages. To support the sound, a visual aid is also provided in the form of an image depicting said word on the card. Likewise, the importance of word formation is also emphasized and used to help the user remember words long term. Memory devices linking the language back to their own native language, user-generated memory, roots of words, and similar words are examples of information that can be stored for each specific card or phrase.

On each card, you can hear the word, hear a sentence with the word, and toggle back and forth between languages. Users can also create their own lessons, with all of the same features available to them. Additionally, users can jot down notes on the word or memory devices, either by recording their cues or typing them. Users create accounts to track progress on their favorite sets and follow lesson plans.

If comparing Onomatic to existing systems, this application takes existing elements from Duolingo and Quizlet, such as flashcards and language learning. However, it adds additional features tailored towards introductory language learners focusing on vocabulary. Onomatic will also provide a core feature allowing for users to record their own audio for phrases, sentences, definitions, and more. Each user-created audio recording will come with information about where the speaker comes from and what type of accent or dialect is used by the speaker. 

Eventually, a question and answer type interface will be integrated into the website. The focus of the interface will be elicitations with other users. For example, one user could ask for someone to say a specific phrase or sentence in a certain dialect or accent, and other users could reply with a recording of their own voice.
