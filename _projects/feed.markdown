**Overview**

Feed is centered around images for one particular food item. Users compile their own descriptiion and recipes including this item, or just the singular ingredient itself. They tell their personal stories behind the food and why it is meaningful to them.

**Problem**

Food revolves around everything that we do. From farm to table, the ingredients that we consume have emotional resonance. The power of familiarity and nolstalgia around food is something that can connect people.

How we're approaching this:

1. A single ingredient: the basic building block of food. How do you use this?
2. A dish: an old family recipe, your favorite order, this could be anything.
3. A restaurant: your local family go-to, a place that's been a mainstay in your community for generations, the hot new establishment, or maybe even a chain restaurant...

All of these different facets of food have stories behind them. We want people to share and connect.
