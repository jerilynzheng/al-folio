**Hello!**

Hi, my name is Jerilyn, and I'm currently a thrid-year student at Cornell University's School of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. I'm a Bay Area native but have also lived on the East Coast and in Beijing, China.

My primary interest is the intersection between technology and people, especially the positive impact and change that this convergence can bring on individual stories and lives. I'm passionate about culture: within different communities, through languages and social interactions, via digital information sharing, and even popular culture.

In high school, I was the varsity coxswain for Deerfield Academy's crew team, leading my boat to a New England Championship and a finals appearance at the national championship. In my free time, I enjoy running, reading, and finding the best new place to eat.
