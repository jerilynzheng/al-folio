##### **Hello!** <br /><br />


##### Hi, my name is Jerilyn, and I'm currently a student at Cornell University's School of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Math. I'm a Bay Area native but have also lived on the East Coast and in Beijing, China.  <br /><br />

##### My primary interest is the intersection between technology and people, especially the positive impact and change that this convergence can bring on individual stories and lives. I'm passionate about culture: within different communities, through languages and social interactions, via digital information sharing, and even popular culture.  <br /><br />

##### In my free time, I enjoy running, reading, and finding the best new place to eat.
