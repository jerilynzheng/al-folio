##### **Hello!** <br /><br />


##### Hi, my name is Jerilyn, and I'm currently a student at Cornell University's School of Engineering, majoring in Computer Science. I'm a Bay Area native but have also lived on the East Coast and in Beijing, China.  <br /><br />

##### My primary interest is the intersection between technology and people, especially the positive impact and change that this convergence can bring on individual stories and lives. I'm passionate about working on teams where I can learn from and collaborate with amazing people on comprehensive projects. I love getting new insights and exposure to different perspectives, expanding my creative and critical thinking horizons. <br /><br />

##### I am in my last year at Cornell and will be working in management consulting in San Francisco at Boston Consulting Group (BCG)</mark>.   <br /><br />

##### In my free time, I enjoy running, reading, and finding the best new place to eat.  <br /><br />

##### If you would like to contact me or simply chat, I can be reached via [email](mailto:jerilynz@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jerilynzheng/).
